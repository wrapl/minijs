Minijs
======

Introduction
------------

*Minijs* is a partial implementation of *Minilang* in *JavaScript*. In particular, it currently implements only the bytecode interpreter and a subset of the core types and library. It can load a *JSON* representation of a *Minilang* function, which can be generated using the :mini:`minijs::encode()` function in the main *Minilang* implementation.
